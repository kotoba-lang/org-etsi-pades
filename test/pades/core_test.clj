  "The arithmetic first, the cryptography second.

  A signed PDF fails in two silent ways — a `/ByteRange` that leaves signature
  bytes inside the signed region, or one that leaves document bytes outside it —
  and neither shows up in a test that only asks whether the signature verifies
  against the range the same code computed. So the range is checked against the
  FILE: every byte is either signed or inside the placeholder, and nothing is
  both or neither."
