  "PAdES (ETSI EN 319 142) baseline signatures — a **writer**, by incremental
  update. Portable `.cljc`.

  ## Why a writer, when the evidence record is already better

  `cloud.itonami.app.esign` produces an evidence record that is more precise
  than a signed PDF: exhaustive outline, frozen status list, DID-named signers.
  A counterparty will not run its verifier. They will open a PDF in Acrobat and
  look for the blue bar.

  So this exists for exactly one job — **hand the outside world something their
  software already checks** — and it does not replace the record. The record
  stays the authority; the PDF is the export.

  ## Incremental update, and the property that makes it a signature at all

  A signed PDF is not rewritten. Everything already in the file stays at the
  byte offset it had, and the signature is **appended**: new objects, a new
  cross-reference section, a new trailer pointing back at the previous one. The
  original bytes are inside the signed range, so a verifier can show that the
  document as-signed is a prefix of the file it is holding.

  Rewriting the file instead — even to produce identical semantics — would mean
  the signature covers bytes the author never saw. This namespace therefore
  never reorders, renumbers or re-serializes an existing object.

  ## /ByteRange and the gap, which is where implementations go wrong

      /ByteRange [0 a b c]

  covers `[0,a)` and `[b,b+c)`. The gap between them is the `/Contents
  <…hex…>` string **including its angle brackets**, because that is the one
  thing that cannot be inside its own digest.

  Two failures follow from getting this wrong and both are silent:

  1. **A gap that does not exactly cover the placeholder** leaves signature
     bytes inside the signed range, or document bytes outside it. Acrobat
     reports the first as invalid and — worse — the second as *valid*, over a
     region an attacker can edit.
  2. **Numbers that change width when filled in** move every following byte.
     So the placeholders are written zero-padded to a fixed width and patched in
     place, never re-rendered. `sign` asserts the length is unchanged after
     patching rather than trusting that it is.

  ## What this is and is not

  **B-B** (basic): the CMS signature and the fields a viewer needs. NOT B-T
  (`signature-timestamp` embeds one, but placing it in the unsigned attributes
  of the CMS is the caller's step), and NOT B-LT/B-LTA, which need a DSS and
  document timestamps. `profile` reports which one a produced file is, so that
  nothing downstream claims a level it did not build."

  16 KiB. A P-256 signature with two certificates is around 2 KiB and an RSA-4096
  chain with a timestamp can pass 10 KiB, so this is generous on purpose: running
  out means re-signing, and the reservation costs disk rather than correctness.
  `sign` refuses rather than truncating if the CMS does not fit — a truncated
  signature is a file that looks signed."
